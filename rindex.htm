      <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>While at university, you should be spending a considerable amount of time studying outside of lectures. This is a tool to help you consider how best to use that time to gain an understanding of the topics covered in the lectures.</p>
<h3>Learning Modes</h3>
<p>We all take in information in a variety of ways, but lectures (generally) tend to follow a set style. Thinking about which learning modes you prefer and how to present information in different ways will help you gain a better understanding of the material and aid in remembering it better. It might take longer to organise your notes differently or to summarise the material, but you can save time later if you understand the course as you go through the semester.</p>
<h3>Thinking Styles</h3>
<p>Working out how you think can help to decide how you should approach exercise sheets as well as what you should do with your time between lectures. Problem sheets are very important in testing and improving your understanding of a topic, so thinking about how to approach them will help you make better use of your time.</p>
<h3>Some Ideas</h3>
<p>Finally, we’ve come up with some ideas of different ideas you could try out to help you understand a topic. Have a look at our examples on ‘Convergence of Sequences’ to give you some suggestions that you might want to apply to other topics.</p>
